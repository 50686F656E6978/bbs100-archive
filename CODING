bbs100 COMES WITH NO WARRANTY. bbs100 IS FREE SOFTWARE.
bbs100 is distributed under terms described in the GNU General Public License.
This means you are allowed to run the code. If you are a programmer, you are
allowed to modify the code. Although the GPL allows this, I do not encourage
it in all cases. From my point of view, bbs100 works and does not need
modification unless the modification is substantial and adds some useful
functionality.

You should READ THE LICENSE and make sure you understand it.
The document ABOUT_GPL underlines the importance of understanding the license.

If you make a useful addition to bbs100, or if you make a bugfix, please
send me a patch in unified diff format and add some documentation on how it
works and why the patch makes things better.
Mind that the GPL states that the GPL applies to your modifications as well.

A lot of features in bbs100 work the way they do by design, and there are
features that were left out _on purpose_ (such as the ability to edit users
from within the BBS). bbs100 is based on freedom for the users, which is
why their IP is invisible to other normal users and why no account validation
is required. Think about this when modifying bbs100.

If you run a modified version of bbs100, be so kind to enter all made
changes into etc/local_mods. This file should list all local modifications
to the original bbs100. It is like a local 'ChangeLog' file. This is purely
to inform your users; they can read about your modifications by pressing ']'.

If you really want your name on the login screen as well, I suggest you add
a line to the original copyright message. Mind that modifying or removing the
original copyright message is prohibited by law.

If you make a useful addition to bbs100, or if you make a bugfix, please
send me a patch and add some documentation on how it works and why you think
it's better this way.

Thank you and happy hacking,
