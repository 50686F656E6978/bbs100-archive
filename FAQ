THE NAME
Why is it called bbs100?
Well, I wanted to call it 'FreeBBS', but the name has been used over and
again by others :(     Also, until now this code wasn't free at all.
On of my previous projects was called 'bbs10' because it was about the 10th
time I started over again writing a BBS.
In 1999, I called it bbs99, and with the new millenium I pretended that it
was a millenium bug and called it bbs100 as a joke. Silly joke of course,
but the name stayed.


PRONOUNCIATION
How is 'bbs100' pronounced?
Just "bee-bee-es one-hundred" or "bee-bee-es-hundred" if you like.


PORTABILITY
What platforms does bbs100 run on?
Basically, it runs on any Unix-like platform.
So far, I've succesfully compiled and run bbs100 on the following platforms:

    Platform                Architecture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Linux 2.x               intel PC  (Debian, RedHat, Slackware)
    Linux 2.x               DEC Alpha (as tested by News of MatrixBBS)
    LinuxPPC                PowerMac  (as tested by Joshua Bell of lumpBBS)
    FreeBSD 3.x / 4.x       intel PC
    NetBSD 1.3              Sun Sparc-1
    Solaris 2.6             Sun Sparc Ultra-1
    SunOS 5.6               Sun Sparc Ultra-1
    AIX 4.2.1 with DFS      IBM RS/6000
    Irix 6.5.x              Silicon Graphics Indy/O2/O200/O2000
    Unicos 10.0.0.x         Cray C90

All this with just configure and make setup.
bbs100 also runs under MacOS X and Windows platforms.
If you run bbs100 on an other platform, feel free to let me know.


YAWC
Why isn't YAWC mentioned anywhere in the README or CREDITS?
Well, YAWC is yet another clone of DOC by Kenneth Haglund (also known as
KHaglund). Last thing I've heard of YAWC is that its source code is not
publicly available anymore. I haven't seen or spoken with KHaglund for
years now.
Anyway, bbs100 borrows not a single bit of the YAWC code (or in fact,
any other code).


MAILING LIST
Is there a centralized place where people can get together and discuss bbs100
related problems?
There currently is a mailing list for coders, which is intended for code
related problems only. Maintainer of the list is CHIPS <chips@hawmps.2y.net>.
