bbs100 by Walter de Jong <walter@heiho.net> (C) 2003

THE NAME
Why is it called bbs100?
Well, I wanted to call it 'FreeBBS', but the name has been used over and
again by others :(     Also, until the year 2000, this code wasn't free at
all. One of my previous projects was called 'bbs10' because it was about
the 10th time I started over again writing a BBS from scratch.
In 1999, I called it bbs99, and with the millenium change I pretended that
it was a millenium bug and called it bbs100 as a joke. Silly joke of course,
but the name stayed.


PRONOUNCIATION
How is 'bbs100' pronounced?
Just "bee-bee-es one-hundred" or "bee-bee-es-hundred" if you like.


PORTABILITY
What platforms does bbs100 run on?
Basically, it runs on any Unix-like platform.
So far, I've succesfully compiled and run bbs100 on the following platforms:

    Platform                Architecture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Linux 2.x               intel PC  (Debian, RedHat, Slackware)
    Linux 2.x               DEC Alpha (as tested by News of MatrixBBS)
    LinuxPPC                PowerMac  (as tested by Joshua Bell of lumpBBS)
    FreeBSD 3.x / 4.x       intel PC
    NetBSD 1.3              Sun Sparc-1
    Solaris 2.6             Sun Sparc Ultra-1
    SunOS 5.6               Sun Sparc Ultra-1
    AIX 4.2.1 with DFS      IBM RS/6000
    Irix 6.5.x              Silicon Graphics Indy/O2/O200/O2000
    Unicos 10.0.0.x         Cray C90

All this with just configure and make setup.
bbs100 also runs under MacOS X and Windows platforms, but you will
need the appropriate patches from the web site to make it work.
The web site is at http://www.heiho.net/bbs100/
If you run bbs100 on an other platform than listed here, please let me
know your experiences in building and running the software.


YAWC
Why isn't YAWC mentioned anywhere in the README or CREDITS?
Well, YAWC is yet another clone of DOC by Kenneth Haglund (also known as
KHaglund). Last thing I've heard of YAWC is that its source code is not
publicly available anymore. I haven't seen or spoken with KHaglund for
years now.
Anyway, bbs100 borrows not a single bit of the YAWC code (or in fact,
any other code).


MAILING LIST
Is there a centralized place where people can get together and discuss bbs100
related problems?
There used to be a mailing list, but it is not active anymore.
If you need help on modifying bbs100, the author (me) is always happy to
provide you with some pointers and explain how specific parts of bbs100 work,
and what you should do to make it work the way you want it to work.
