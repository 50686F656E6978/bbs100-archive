Changes as of December 15th 1999
After a year I have decided to finally go keep a history log.
It's been about 4 to 5 months since I've done _anything_ on the code, so
it was like meeting an old friend ;)

- crash handler now attempts recovery: keep the bbs running anyway
  This function is highly experimental (don't be surprised if it messes up)
- editing multiple recipients now works better (had a problem in Mail>)
- reply to one person won't require a <return>
- followup mode won't require a <return>
- terminal size was not remembered if user made a mistake while logging in
- when profiling someone who is not online, the name is not remembered
  (and thus fixing the stupid message 'In the meantime, %s has logged off' when
   he/she never was online)
- SIGQUIT reboots the bbs in 5 minutes
- SIGABRT shuts the bbs down in 5 minutes
- SIGTERM does a quick shutdown (save all users and exit)
- SIGUSR1 checks for new mail for all online users
- RAs now have more options in the Room Config menu
- hidden and/or invite-only rooms are now handled correctly (no longer appear8
  as Zapped)
  RAs of such rooms should increase the generation number of the room in order
  to make everything work correctly (which also causes everyone to re-read the
  room)
- room aide functions will be automatically enabled when a RA presses Ctrl-R
  in his/her room
- users are now saved every 10 minutes
- known rooms ('k') and all known rooms ('K') now print list in the same order
- fixed default reboot/shutdown time in sysop menu
- the Mail> room now can have room info (even though it's not possible to set
  from within the bbs)
