Welcome to bbs100. This is an example of roominfo for the first room
a user enters when he or she logs in to the BBS.
It should state something like this:
  
There are just a few issues:
1) This bbs serves 1 purpose only: Enjoyment. Nothing more, nothing less.
   It's not meant to be a substitute for real life, nor is it something to
   be taken extremely seriously. People come here to enjoy themselves, not
   to get pissed off. This goes for the users as well as the sysops.
2) All rooms are to be posted in in English, unless indicated otherwise.
   Room aides are responsible for their rooms, and the sysops are respon-
   sible for all board matters.
3) Discrimination or racial slander is not acceptable. Freedom of speech
   does not mean freedom to attack someone's cultural heratige, religious
   beliefs or sexual preferences. All legal issues subject to US law.

For Help, press 'h'.
  
Sysops on this board are: Sysop1 and Sysop2
