  write_pidfile() used PARAM_PID_FILE even before the param file was loaded

  Big thanks also go to CHIPS for maintaining the bbs100 coding mailing
  list. The list is gone now but it was fun while it lasted.

  not work correctly on FreeBSD 4.0 with MD5 encryption algorithm

  can lock the screen, which is pretty annoying

  using the Room Config menu option Ctrl-R, users are not able to see new
  posts. You should reset the creation date as well. This is something you
  don't want to do for invite-only rooms. It is still a bug, but in 1.1.13
  it prints a warning message about it.

  editing (this was already available with Ctrl-R)

  a room. I guess it's more logical that way

  the new message header doesn't reflect that status until you read the
  posted message

  editing and not just Ctrl-V. Although it tends to mess up ASCII art,
  eventually I gave in

- Vonda suggested that people who have messages put on hold, are not able
  to send messages themselves

  window immediately when disconnecting

- Vonda noted that notification messages should not be received out of order

  while editing was not pretty

  recipients of the multi message, rather than to the single person who did
  not receive the message

- English Buchanan found a problem with Zap All
