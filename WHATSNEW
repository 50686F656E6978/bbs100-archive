 * Sysop can review the slab cache statistics in the Sysop menu
 * default files for worldclock are in /usr/share/zoneinfo


--

bbs100 version 3.2 is a minor update to version 3.1. Most important changes:
 * fixed a bug that could crash the BBS
 * the Help function is now a menu system; update any custom Help files
   if you have them
   See the UPGRADING file for more information.

The rest of this file is about what is new in version 3.1 and 3.0.

bbs100 version 3.1 is a minor update to version 3.0. Most important are the
updated timezone files to keep the right track of time.
The rest of this file is about what is new in version 3.0.

It's finally here, bbs100 version 3.0. I never thought we'd have a version 3,
but so much has changed internally, that there was no way around it.

What's new to the users?
There are a lot of new options in the Config menu:

- vanity flag that appears in the user's profile info
- personal customizable eXpress Message header
- option of hiding the address information in the profile info
  from people who are not on the friends list
  This option is under Config|Address
- the Terminal Settings menu has a number of new options;
  - hotkeys can be shown bright/bold
  - hotkeys can be shown in uppercase
  - hotkeys can be shown with angle brackets
  - terminal screen width and height can be adjusted if needed;
    the BBS detects correct screen width and height
  - user can choose 'classic' or 'modern' color scheme;
    the classic color scheme looks more like DOC, while
    the modern color scheme has a more dynamic look;
    What it does is automatically color symbols, giving subtle accents
    to strings
  - user can customize what characters are automatically colored, and
    what color they will have
- the friends/enemies menu now are in the same style as the other
  Config menus
- the Options submenu is entirely new;
  - users can choose to have sequence numbers displayed in the
    eXpress message header
  - Hold message mode when busy selects a more modern way of reading
    held messages after you were busy
  - users may choose whether they want to give a reason when they
    lock the terminal or go into Hold message mode
  - users may choose whether a room generates a beep when someone makes
    a new post in that room
  - if you like, you won't be stuck in the Lobby> when there are no new
    messages, but be cycled around to urge you to post somewhere
  - choose whether downloaded text shows color codes in long or short format
  - choose whether downloads pause every screen or not
  - 'verbose friend notification' shows even more friend notifications
  - choose whether 'p' shows long or short profile
  - users may choose to hide their profile info from enemies
  - default room can be set; this is convenient when posting a lot in a
    specific high traffic room, eg. Babble>
  - user can set that Upload is the default for entering messages
  - you can have X disable block friends as well

- 'p' shows long profile info, 'P' shows short profile info
- when entering colors into a message, the colors are immediately displayed
- color codes take up only 1 position
- yet another notation of color codes is possible, using the caret or
  the tilde (whichever you prefer)
- Tab can be used to expand long color codes
- the tab character can be used in messages, it expands to 4 spaces
- on smaller terminals, the BBS will do word-wrapping
- on smaller terminals, the BBS will display --More-- prompts for menus
  that would otherwise scroll off the screen
- the boss key hides what you're doing (for when the boss walks by)
- X History has a new look and most functions work on that prompt as well
- Held messages prompt has a new look and most functions work on that
  prompt as well
- the known rooms list may show room categories
- it prints the online status after unlocking
- chat rooms scroll messages in a better way
- when undeleting a deleted message, you first get to read the message
  and then you have the choice of undeleting it or not
- 's' skips the room so you get to read the messages later on
  (this is a change; 's' used to be Stop reading, but it was annoying.
  To stop reading, enter something like '+1000' to go to the last post
  in the room)
- Read New shows the number of new messages
- profile info can be downloaded
- users can send eXpress messages to themselves again, which is especially
  nice if you want to see what a specific Feeling looks like
- when deleting a Mail> message, it will also delete the recipient's copy
- it is possible to undelete multi-Mail>s as well
- when message reception is turned off, the people that you X, may X you
  back
- press 'o' at room level to manage your override list, go via the Friends
  and Enemies menu


What's new to the admins?
- room aides can download the room info
- IPv6 wrappers; IPv4 wrappers are also still available
- option 'wrapper apply to all' or 'wrapper applies to new users only'
- per-room maximum of messages
- rooms can be in a category
- 'since boot' statistics in the Statistics screen
- nologin shown more clearly in Sysop menu, when active
- nologin persists after a reboot via file etc/nologin.is.active
- cancel reboot works with the same key as reboot
  this kills the function of reprogramming a running reboot timer,
  but hey ...
- cancel shutdown works with the same key as shutdown
  this kills the function of reprogramming a running shutdown timer,
  but hey ...
- when entering a message as sysop or room aide, it shows it to the posting
  user in the header
- param umask controls the umask
- param bind_address allows you to bind to a specific interface;
  especially binding to localhost can be useful
- configurable notification string for when a user uses Hold message mode
- configurable minimum age for users that want to be a Helping Hand
- option of keeping room info and profile info resident in memory or not
- when locked, Sysops must use their Sysop password to unlock
- Lobby> can be a chat room without problems
- who-list for a room has been removed to respect the privacy of the users
- long profile shows user's BBS birth date
  (users can see theirs in the Statistics screen)
- Help files and screens can be uploaded from the sysop menu
- sysop can add/remove feelings from the sysop menu
- sysop can view the logfiles from within the BBS, including the new log
  that logs all new users
- guess-name rooms can be toggled on or off; a guess-name room is a hidden
  but public room, that the user can join if he/she knows the room name.
  Turning this feature off makes hidden rooms appear as non-existent to users
  who are not invited or room aide there.
- sysop menu shows extensive information on the BinAlloc memory allocator
  if it is enabled
- make live core dumps for debugging when built with -DEBUG


What's new internally?
- configure with --enable-debug=no to leave out extra debug code
- configure with --enable-binalloc to build with BinAlloc support
- IPv6 capable networking code
- object oriented Conn (connection) class, implemented in standard C
- new mainloop handles connections flawlessly; it does correct input
  and output buffering
- much use of new type StringIO, which are automatically growing buffers
  rather than lists of strings
  (less memory fragmentation)
- much use of new type Queue, which is a foundation for lists. It does
  adding, prepending, and counting of objects in an efficient way
- much use of new type KVPair (key-value pair)
- messages in the X History are reference counted rather than copied;
  (this is fast and saves memory)
- cached files are referenced rather than copied;
  (this is fast and saves memory)
- talked-to list is generated from X history rather than copied
  (this is not fast, but does save memory)
- feelings are cached rather than always resident
  (this saves memory)
- the feelings menu is no longer kept in memory
- the timezone menu's are no longer pre-indexed
- helping hands are selected in an efficient way
- scalability: mail is sent, deleted, and undeleted in a loop
- CRC-32 is used for computing hash keys
  (far less cache collisions, and it's not all that much slower either)
- room info and profile info can be 'offline', not permanently resident
  in memory
  (this saves memory)
- ROOM_DIRTY flag prevents unnecessary saving of rooms
  (this is more efficient)
- Put() now calls Out(), which calls Out_text(), which does word-wrapping
  and auto-coloring of symbols
  (slow, but it looks cool)
- output can be buffered temporarily and then be displayed with a --More--
  prompt by a simple call to buffer_text()
- CALLX() can directly call into a substate different from INIT_STATE
- RETX() can return to a substate different from INIT_STATE
- temp variables between states can be passed via the CallStack by using
  PUSH_ARG() and POP_ARG(), eliminating some dirty hacks
- state_room.c holds room prompt functions; most common functions are
  done in state.c in fun_common()
- bufprintf() and bufvprintf(), which map to snprintf() and vsnprintf(),
  if HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF are defined in config.h
- bounds checking against buffer overruns with cstrcpy() and cstrcat()
- hostmap is no longer permanently loaded, but works through the file cache
- BinAlloc memory allocator minimizes fragmentation if it is enabled
  (bins of a different type but the same size are linked together)
- rooms no longer keep an index of messages, but only a head and tail
  pointer
  (this saves memory and is much, much faster)
- patches may be listed in patchlist.c so that everyone can see which
  patches have been applied
- usr->flags2 adds some more config bits
- new zoneinfo files so the time keeps being displayed correctly
- a seperate 'guard' process reboots the BBS when needed
- lists are now sorted using merge sort, much more efficient than the way
  it used to be
- some bugs fixed ...
