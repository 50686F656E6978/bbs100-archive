It's finally here, bbs100 version 3.0. I never thought we'd have a version 3,
but so much has changed internally, that there was no way around it.

What's new to the users?
There are a lot of new options in the Config menu:

- vanity flag that appears in the user's profile info
- personal customizable eXpress Message header
- option of hiding the address information in the profile info
  from people who are not on the friends list
  This option is under Config|Address
- the Terminal Settings menu has a number of new options;
  - hotkeys can be shown bright/bold
  - hotkeys can be shown in uppercase
  - hotkeys can be shown with angle brackets
  - terminal screen width and height can be adjusted if needed;
    the BBS detects correct screen width and height
  - user can choose 'classic' or 'modern' color scheme;
    the classic color scheme looks more like DOC, while
    the modern color scheme has a more dynamic look;
    What it does is automatically color symbols, giving subtle accents
    to strings
  - user can customize what characters are automatically colored, and
    what color they will have
- the friends/enemies menu now are in the same style as the other
  Config menus
- the Options submenu is entirely new;
  - users can choose to have sequence numbers displayed in the
    eXpress message header
  - Hold message mode when busy selects a more modern way of reading
    held messages after you were busy
  - users may choose whether they want to give a reason when they
    lock the terminal or go into Hold message mode
  - users may choose whether a room generates a beep when someone makes
    a new post in that room
  - choose whether downloaded text shows color codes in long or short format
  - choose whether downloads pause every screen or not
  - 'verbose friend notification' shows even more friend notifications
  - choose whether 'p' shows long or short profile
  - users may choose to hide their profile info from enemies
  - default room can be set; this is convenient when posting a lot in a
    specific high traffic room, eg. Babble>
  - user can set that Upload is the default for entering messages
  - you can have X disable block friends as well

- 'p' shows long profile info, 'P' shows short profile info
- when entering colors into a message, the colors are immediately displayed
- color codes take up only 1 position
- yet another notation of color codes is possible, using the caret or
  the tilde (whichever you prefer)
- Tab can be used to expand long color codes
- the tab character can be used in messages, it expands to 4 spaces
- on smaller terminals, the BBS will do word-wrapping
- on smaller terminals, the BBS will display --More-- prompts for menus
  that would otherwise scroll off the screen
- the boss key hides what you're doing (for when the boss walks by)
- X History has a new look and most functions work on that prompt as well
- Held messages prompt has a new look and most functions work on that
  prompt as well
- the known rooms list may show room categories
- if configured by the sysop, you won't be stuck in the Lobby> when
  there are no new messages, but be cycled around to urge you to post
  somewhere
- it prints the online status after unlocking
- chat rooms scroll messages in a better way
- when undeleting a deleted message, you first get to read the message
  and then you have the choice of undeleting it or not
- 's' skips the room so you get to read the messages later on
  (this is a change; 's' used to be Stop reading, but it was annoying.
  To stop reading, enter something like '+1000' to go to the last post
  in the room)
- Read New shows the number of new messages
- profile info can be downloaded
- users can send eXpress messages to themselves again, which is especially
  nice if you want to see what a specific Feeling looks like
- when deleting a Mail> message, it will also delete the recipient's copy
- it is possible to undelete multi-Mail>s as well
- when message reception is turned off, the people that you X, may X you
  back
- press 'o' at room level to manage your override list, go via the Friends
  and Enemies menu


What's new to the admins?
- room aides can download the room info
- IPv6 wrappers; IPv4 wrappers are also still available
- option 'wrapper apply to all' or 'wrapper applies to new users only'
- per-room maximum of messages
- rooms can be in a category
- 'since boot' statistics in the Statistics screen
- nologin shown more clearly in Sysop menu, when active
- cancel reboot works with the same key as reboot
  this kills the function of reprogramming a running reboot timer,
  but hey ...
- cancel shutdown works with the same key as shutdown
  this kills the function of reprogramming a running shutdown timer,
  but hey ...
- when entering a message as sysop or room aide, it shows it to the posting
  user in the header
- param umask controls the umask
- param bind_address allows you to bind to a specific interface;
  especially binding to localhost can be useful
- configurable notification string for when a user uses Hold message mode
- configurable minimum age for users that want to be a Helping Hand
- option of keeping room info and profile info resident in memory or not
- when locked, Sysops must use their Sysop password to unlock
- sysop menu shows extensive information on the BinAlloc memory allocator
- Lobby> can be a chat room without problems
- who-list for a room has been removed to respect the privacy of the users
- long profile shows user's BBS birth date
  (users can see theirs in the Statistics screen)
- Help files and screens can be uploaded from the sysop menu
- sysop can add/remove feelings from the sysop menu
- sysop can view the logfiles from within the BBS


What's new internally?
- IPv6 capable networking code
- object oriented Conn (connection) class, implemented in standard C
- new mainloop handles connections flawlessly; it does correct input
  and output buffering
- much use of new type StringIO, which are automatically growing buffers
  rather than lists of strings
  (less memory fragmentation)
- much use of new type Queue, which is a foundation for lists. It does
  adding, prepending, and counting of objects in an efficient way
- much use of new type KVPair (key-value pair)
- messages in the X History are reference counted rather than copied;
  (this is fast and saves memory)
- cached files are referenced rather than copied;
  (this is fast and saves memory)
- talked-to list is generated from X history rather than copied
  (this is not fast, but does save memory)
- feelings are cached rather than always resident
  (this saves memory)
- helping hands are selected in an efficient way
- scalability: mail is sent, deleted, and undeleted in a loop
- CRC-32 is used for computing hash keys
  (far less cache collisions, and it's not all that much slower either)
- room info and profile info can be 'offline', not permanently resident
  in memory
  (this saves memory)
- ROOM_DIRTY flag prevents unnecessary saving of rooms
  (this is more efficient)
- Put() now calls Out(), which calls Out_text(), which does word-wrapping
  and auto-coloring of symbols
  (slow, but it looks cool)
- output can be buffered temporarily and then be displayed with a --More--
  prompt by a simple call to buffer_text()
- CALLX() can directly call into a substate different from INIT_STATE
- RETX() can return to a substate different from INIT_STATE
- temp variables between states can be passed via the CallStack by using
  PUSH_ARG() and POP_ARG(), eliminating some dirty hacks
- state_room.c holds room prompt functions; most common functions are
  done in state.c in fun_common()
- bufprintf() and bufvprintf(), which map to snprintf() and vsnprintf(),
  if HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF are defined in config.h
- bounds checking against buffer overruns with cstrcpy() and cstrcat()
- hostmap is no longer permanently loaded, but works through the file cache
- BinAlloc memory allocator minimizes fragmentation
  (bins of a different type but the same size are linked together)
- rooms no longer keep an index of messages, but only a head and tail
  pointer
  (this saves memory and is much, much faster)
- patches may be listed in patchlist.c so that everyone can see which
  patches have been applied
- OnlineUser list is a Tree rather than a Hash ... this has both cons
  and pros; the biggest pro is that a Tree doesn't have a costly resize
  like a Hash does
- usr->flags2 adds some more config bits
- some bugs fixed ...
