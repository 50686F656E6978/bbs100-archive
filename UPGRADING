bbs100 COMES WITH NO WARRANTY. bbs100 IS FREE SOFTWARE.
bbs100 is distributed under terms described in the GNU General Public License.

To upgrade from an existing version of bbs100, do the following:
- read the ChangeLog to see what's new
- some versions may come with a WHATSNEW file, but not all
  If the WHATSNEW file is present, read it
- check the files UPGRADING, INSTALL, and README for new information
- check the etc/ directory for new files and changes in files (namely the
  Help files may change)
- check the etc/param file for new parameters

- make the new version:
  * cd src ; ./configure --prefix={your prefix}
  * make install

  This installs the new binaries in ${prefix}/bin-${version}/
  and symlinks it to ${prefix}/bin

- verify that the new binaries have been installed correctly
- inform your users and reboot the BBS
  The new version should come up in a few seconds if all goes well.


CLEANING UP
The make upgrade process leaves the old bin directory of the BBS intact.
If you are satisfied with the new version, you can safely remove the old
bin directory.


ERRORS
If you are running a pre-1.1.2 installation of bbs100, you may get the
following error:

    /bin/rm: /home/bbs/bin: is a directory

Or something like that, at the end of 'make upgrade'. To solve this, do the
following:

    ( cd /home/bbs ; mv bin bin-pre-1.1.2 )

Now try 'make install' again, and you should be alright.


THE PARAM FILE
The etc/param file contains a parameter 'bindir'. People tend to think they
have to update this parameter each time they install a new version. However,
the opposite is true; 'bindir' should be set to 'bin' at all times -- the
symbolic link provides 'bin' for us.
Same goes for the parameters program_main and program_resolver.
You should never have to touch these.
