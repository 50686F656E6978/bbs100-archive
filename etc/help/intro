<green>A <yellow>bbs100<green> BBS is a bulletin board system that offers:

* interactive chat with other users that are currently online
  (this is known as the <yellow>eXpress Message<green> or Xmsg system)

* discussion through messages posted in rooms

* IRC-like chat in the chatrooms

The system is primarily aimed at fun for everyone. Users that
misbehave can be expelled (or: banished) from the BBS.

Every room has its own topic. If your post is off-topic, it may be
removed by the <yellow>Room Aide<green> (or RA), who manages the room.
All rooms have a unique room number. Some people prefer to remember
room numbers, but you may also go to a room by its name.
Rooms that have topics that are in the same category, are often said
to be on the same floor.

Through interactive chat, you may send messages to other users that
are currently online. bbs100 offers three main kinds of messages:
<yellow>
* eXpress Messages<green>
  This is the most common message, that may be a couple of lines long
<yellow>
* Emotes<green>
  One-liner that usally expresses what you are doing now or how you
  are feeling at this moment
<yellow>
* Feelings<green>
  Pre-fab messages (often containing some ASCII art) to display
  your feelings

You may also ask <yellow>Questions<green> through interactive chat. Questions are
automatically received by <yellow>Helping Hands;<green> these users are available
to help others. If you are experienced enough, you can make yourself
available to help others, too.

If a particular person is not online right now, you can leave a
message in the <yellow>Mail<green> room. The Mail will be read as soon as he
or she returns.

Every user on bbs100 has his own <yellow>profile<green> information, to present
yourself to others. Your profile can be customized in the <yellow>Config
Menu.<green> Press<white> <Ctrl-C><green> to enter the Config menu.

Add fun people to your <yellow>Friends<green> list, and block people if you have to.
