Put people you know on your <yellow>Friend<green> list. With<yellow> <Ctrl-F><green> you
will be able to quickly see who of your friends is online.

Users can send you messages, unless you have message reception
disabled. Users that are on your friend list can <yellow>always<green> contact
you, unless you are explicitly blocking them; there is an option
to do this in the Config menu.
You can use your enemy list to block annoying users.

When you have turned off message reception, you can still send
messages to people, and they will be able to answer as they are
automatically unblocked -- they are placed on a socalled <yellow>override<green>
list. The override list is managed automatically by the BBS, but
it is also possible to edit it by hand.

It is possible to <yellow>hide<green> your <yellow>profile<green> information from people.
You can enable this option in the Config menu.
