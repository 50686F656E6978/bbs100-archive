<white>Note:<green> When a user or room is deleted, it is moved to the <yellow>trash/<green> folder.
      Thus, a system administrator should able to restore the deleted data.
      There is no way to do this from within the BBS.

Any changes in the <yellow>Parameters<green> subsection are made in real-time. This means
that changes to parameters come into effect immediately. The parameters are
saved in the param file as soon as you leave the subsection. To discard these
changes and revert to the old configuration, you can <yellow>Reload<green> the param file
before exiting the <yellow>Parameters<green> submenu.
