Users can send you messages, unless you have message reception
<yellow>disabled. <green>When you have turned off message reception, you can still
send messages to people, and they will be able to answer as they are
automatically unblocked. For more information, see the Help section
about <yellow>Friends and Enemies.<green>

You can temporarily put messages <yellow>on hold.<green> This is particularly
convenient if you prefer to read all new messages, before engaging
in chat.

The <yellow>Follow up<green> (or auto reply) mode ensures you never forget to
answer someone.
